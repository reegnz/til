Github has a pretty straightforward description on how to get
a page up and running in a few minutes [here](https://pages.github.com/).

The Jekyll-specific parts of the github documentation are somewhat lacking
though.

The [structure page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) for jekyll didn't
help a lot either.

Then I have encountered [jsanz/gh-pages-minima-starter](https://github.com/jsanz/gh-pages-minima-starter)
which was just what I needed to get started.

One big difference is that I didn't use a footer, and a Gemfile.
