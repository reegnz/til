# Setting up a GitHub Pages blog with Jekyll

Github has a pretty straightforward description on how to get
a page up and running in a few minutes [here](https://pages.github.com/).

The Jekyll-specific parts of the github documentation are somewhat lacking
though.

The [structure page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) and the
... page were probably the most useful during the setup of this blog.
